NAME
    CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::NoBugTracker - CPAN Test Dummy that explicitly
    says there is no bug tracker

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::NoBugTracker;

DESCRIPTION
    This module tests the behaviour of the CPAN ecosystem in the case of a
    author which does not make use of a bugtracker.

    This module was created to assist Marc Lehmann and prove that parts of
    the CPAN ecosystem correctly obey instructions to not have a bugtracker.

    Contains no functionality, and will never do so.
